# Install

```

$ brew install po
$ po install
```

# Why use the Homebrew Edition of po-util?

The Homebrew Edition of po-util makes installing and using po-util much cleaner. It doesn't rely on bash aliases, it has releases, and is more stable.

Note: Both versions of po-util have the same features. In December 2016, Homebrew Edition was forked from po-util in order to allow po-util to be installed with Homebrew. The original po-util was renamed to Classic, and was made Linux exclusive. Both Classic and Homebrew Edition continue to be developed and maintained in parallel.

# [Starter Guide](https://github.com/nrobinson2000/po-util/wiki/macOS-Guide)

The starter guide on the po-util Wiki has instructions for setting up po-util, updating device firmware and using po-util.
