# Particle Offline Utility: The Ultimate Local Particle Experience for Linux and macOS

This is the repository for the [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) version of [**po-util**](https://github.com/nrobinson2000/po-util).

# Install

    $ brew tap nrobinson2000/po
    $ brew update
    $ brew install po
    $ po install

# Why use the Homebrew version of po-util?

The Homebrew version of po-util makes installing and using po-util much cleaner.  It doesn't rely on bash aliases, and is more stable.

I recommend the Homebrew version of po-util instead of normal po-util if you are on macOS.
