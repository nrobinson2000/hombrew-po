# Particle Offline Utility: The Ultimate Local Particle Experience for Linux and macOS - Homebrew Edition

This is the repository for the [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) Edition of [**po-util**](https://github.com/nrobinson2000/po-util).

# Install

```
$ brew tap nrobinson2000/po
$ brew install po
$ po install
```

# Why use the Homebrew Edition of po-util?

The Homebrew Edition of po-util makes installing and using po-util much cleaner. It doesn't rely on bash aliases, it has releases, and is more stable.

I recommend the Homebrew version of po-util over the original version of po-util if you are on macOS.
